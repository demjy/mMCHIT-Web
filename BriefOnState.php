          <p><strong>At</strong> the time of visit, the galaxy equipments were newly  installed, we  found that many staff members at the site had only heard
            about the 'new computer' but had not used it. At the general hospital,it was kept in the doctor's office, almost 200yards away 
            from the maternal child clinic. It was being used exclusively by the doctors to check their emails and Google search. We found
            the sites to be adequately staffed and most of them expressed interest in ICT. In fact, a midwife in Ideani PHC was already taking computer lessons and paying NGN30, 000 out of pocket for 12 sessions. At the GH, we interviewed their Medical Records Officer (MRO) 
            who complained about the workload and lack of support. Although she is a 56year old MRO nearing retirement, who  described herself as 'an illiterate of computers', she still expressed an interest in learning. She noted that an ICT initiative like mMCHIT could relieve her of 25%-50% of her workload. Out of the 4 PHCs, only PHC Nibo had a dedicated records officer who was  trained  in Microsoft word and Microsoft Excel. <a href="Anambra.php">view gallery</a>.</p>

          <p><strong>The</strong> general hospital in our cluster, GH Dambam was the first one we were unable to find a single medical doctor on duty. 
            The chief nursing officer ran the affairs of the hospital and informed us that the youth corper doctor they had had just 
            finished his service period. The galaxy equipment  in   this  hospital  was  installed  in  the  hospital's  secretary's 
            office  which  is  in  a  separate  (mostly abandoned) building  and  almost 200  yards  away  from  the maternity section.
            In PHC Gwaram, we observed a very community centric approach to care. The midwives and CHEWs regularly went out on outreach activities and frequently consulted with the community leaders and religious leader on the need for women to be delivered by 
            a skilled birth attendant. In fact, we were unable to find a woman in the community who wasn't being delivered by a skilled 
            birthing attendant. They disclosed that most of the TBAs were also serving as health attendants in their PHC. The inclusion 
            of religious and community leaders in primary health care activities is a common practice in Bauchi; the recent successes recorded in polio eradication are partly due to this. Our experience  in Bauchi suggests  that  there  is more  to be done          in engaging  these  local authorities on the MSS program. In other PHCs (apart from Gwaram), we observed women who 
            did not utilize  the PHCs due  to  ignorance or  instructions  from a misinformed spouse. <a href="Bauchi.php">view gallery</a></p>

          <p><strong>Bayelsa</strong> has a very peculiar terrain been situated in the Niger Delta region of the country. Many of the facilities are water-locked 
            and access is very difficult. This was evident to the Team who had to  use various means of  transportation  to reach  these  facilities. 
            The manpower situation in the state is very poor. Many of the Staff including the MSS midwives were not on ground with very few staff manning          most of the stations, most of them giving the bad terrain as reasons  for  the poor staff attendance.  The State of  the deployed Galaxy equipment          has a picture akin  to  the situation  in Ekiti State; poorly maintained and sparsely used systems. A  very  useful  and  interesting  phenomenon 
            observed  in  the  state  was  the  demonstration  of community integration in one of the facilities; Ayakoro PHC. The TBA  in this community has been 
            fully integrated into the PHC System. The TBA now takes her deliveries supervised by the Health workers  in  the Facility. She  also  serves  as  a 
            vital  link  to  the  community  and provides useful information  to help  the workers  to carry out good community diagnosis. The  integration of TBAs  is 
            one of  the windows we seek  to explore  in  the mMCHIT project. <a href="Bayelsa.php">veiw gallery</a>..</p>

          <p><strong>The</strong> deployed Galaxy equipment were  inspected for completeness and functionality as well as usage. It was however disappointing 
            that most of  the  facilities were yet  to  fully utilize  the  full potential of  the equipment. This phenomenon was  largely 
            blamed on  the  lack of  training on ICT  for the  target staff.There were  also major  issues  regarding  the maintenance  of
            these  systems  as  a number have technical  faults both on  the soft and hardware components. There were however some strengths 
            found in the State. Most of the National Midwives were on ground and they demonstrated good knowledge and integration with the host          communities.  The Focus Group Discussion held at  the end of  the exercise provided excellent material  for future..<a href="Ekiti.php">view gallery</a></p>

          <p><strong>The</strong> picture  in Niger State was not different  from the other states apart  from the  fact that the facilities were located very far apart (with one of the facilities about 200km away from the referral GH),  bringing  into question  the  feasibility of  the cluster concept. The Galaxy equipment  in the GH was  installed  in one of the general consulting rooms several metres away from the maternity unit and the computer was serving as a mini internet café for the hospital  community.  In  contrast,  the  equipment  in  the PHCs had  largely been neglected and sparingly used. A major challenge in the state was the widespread unavailability of the facility staff including the MSS midwives.   Tracking  the  continuous attendance of  the midwives at  the various  facilities appears  to  be  daunting  for  the  focal  person  in  view  of  the  terrain.  It  is  noteworthy  that  the deployment of the mMCHIT project will seek to address this challenge not only in the state but across  the country.</p>

          <p><strong>As</strong> at  the  time of visit,  training on  the Galaxy equipment was still pending. Just as we saw  in  the  first leg, many workers were
            not adequately  informed about  the use of  the computers or  the ICT goals of the NPHCDA. At the GH, most people were of the mpression          that the galaxy equipment had been donated not by the NPHCDA but by their local government representative (congressman). Our team was well 
            received and  the  local government chairman (similar  to a mayor) was gracious enough to receive us at his office and provided us with a 
            comfortable means of transportation. Overall, the sites in Sokoto were well equipped but inadequately staffed. We saw a functioning ultrasound 
            machine at PHC Kilgori but there was nobody on staff who was trained to operate it. Going through the cumbersome ANC registries, we noticed that 
            the ANC attendance rates have increased since the deployment of the MSS midwives. However, the rates of onsite delivery have not been as  impressive.          PHC Bijin Muza, a newly constructed model PHC was off the power grid and it was a 1 hour drive away from the GH. The workers informed us that work was          under way to connect the site to the national power grid before the end of the year. Another problem was that there was no GSM signal within the compound.          As a result,  in order  to send SMS with  the MADEX enabled mobile phones, a health worker has  to walk about 50yards away  from  the PHC. <a href="Sokoto.php">view gallery</a>.</p>
